# EU Open Banking MCP

A self-hosted, read-only MCP server for accessing personal European bank accounts through [Enable Banking](https://enablebanking.com/), secured and deployed on Cloudflare Workers.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cver-me/eu-open-banking-mcp)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Treat every deployment as a private financial system. The repository is open source; your Worker, MCP URL, secrets, session IDs, account IDs, and financial data are private.

## Why this exists

[ChatGPT Finances](https://openai.com/index/personal-finance-chatgpt/) shows what becomes possible when an assistant can reason over real balances and transactions. Its account connection is powered by Plaid and is currently available in the United States.

I built this project because I could not find a comparably direct, self-hostable path for European personal accounts. Europe has Open Banking, but individuals still reach bank data through regulated providers whose production onboarding and APIs vary. [Plaid's published MCP servers](https://plaid.com/docs/resources/mcp/) are useful for developer tooling and production diagnostics; they do not expose a person's balances and transactions as personal-finance MCP tools.

This project fills that narrow gap: one person deploys one private MCP, authorizes only their own bank accounts, and lets their chosen MCP clients perform bounded read-only analysis. It is infrastructure for personal use, not a hosted financial product or a multi-user aggregator.

## Why Enable Banking

Of the providers evaluated, Enable Banking offered the simplest fit for a self-hosted personal deployment. Its restricted-production mode explicitly allows an application to be activated by linking the owner's own accounts before signing a commercial agreement, including for individual non-commercial use. The application can then read only those linked accounts. See Enable Banking's [restricted-production account guide](https://enablebanking.com/docs/api/linked-accounts).

That model matches this project's security boundary:

- the Enable Banking dashboard is the account whitelist;
- the bank's authorization flow creates the revocable API consent;
- the MCP exposes only fixed read operations over accounts covered by both.

Dashboard linking is not itself API authorization. After deployment, `/setup` still sends the owner through their bank's consent flow and stores the resulting Enable Banking session ID. This second step is required even when the same account was already linked in the dashboard.

## Architecture

  C[ChatGPT, Codex, or another MCP client] --> A[Cloudflare Access]

  W -->|request-scoped RS256 JWT| E[Enable Banking]
  E --> B[Your bank]
```

- Client → MCP: Cloudflare Access Managed OAuth, restricted to the deployment owner.
- MCP → Enable Banking: a one-hour RS256 JWT signed from a private key stored as a Worker secret. Signing is shared across provider calls within one incoming request; tokens are not shared between requests.
- Storage: KV contains only Enable Banking session IDs created through the protected setup flow.
- Online account reads: the Worker forwards Cloudflare's connecting-client IP and the MCP client's
  User-Agent as Enable Banking's `Psu-Ip-Address` and `Psu-User-Agent` headers. These request-scoped
  values are not stored or logged. This tells the bank that the signed-in owner actively requested
  the data.

The Worker does not store balances, transactions, account UUIDs, IBANs, authorization codes, or provider responses. Responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Bounds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `finance_list_accounts` | Discover active accounts and bank-provided metadata | 20 authorized sessions, 20 active accounts |
| `finance_get_balances` | One discovered account or all active accounts | Partial per-account results; sequential within each bank |
| `finance_get_spending` | Gross debit estimate with date provenance and separate booked/pending/held totals | 366 days, 20 pages, 10,000 matching transactions, 200 returned details |
| `finance_list_transactions` | Paginated normalized transactions | 366 days, 200 results per response |
| `finance_search_transactions` | Text search over transaction metadata | 366 days, 5 provider pages, 100 matches |
| `finance_summarize_cash_flow` | Booked credit/debit/net totals by currency | 366 days, 20 pages, 10,000 transactions |

`finance_list_accounts` returns an opaque, session-specific `accountId`. Tools that target one account accept that ID and verify it against the active Enable Banking sessions before use. No aliases or manually copied account UUIDs are required. All-account reads deduplicate sessions referring to the same primary account identity hash, when supplied by Enable Banking. These hashes stay in request memory and are never exposed or persisted; names and secondary fuzzy hashes are never used to guess account identity.

Pagination `nextCursor` values contain encoded continuation state; they are opaque but not confidential. Return them unchanged with the same account and filters. The Worker validates their embedded context before use.

Every tool is read-only, non-destructive, and idempotent. Provider codes are normalized into descriptive values such as `interim_available`, `booked`, and `professional`. Multiple balances for one account are alternative measurements and must never be added together. Balance labels and bank timestamps are preserved; a fresh fetch does not establish a fresh measurement. Monetary calculations never combine currencies. Provider amount strings are bounded to 100 characters, and aggregation precision accommodates mixed decimal scales and the 10,000-entry limit without rounding.

For everyday spending questions, `finance_get_spending` scans all active accounts unless one is selected. Its default response contains totals and completeness information; set `includeTransactions: true` for up to 200 supporting entries with `effectiveDate` and `dateSource`. It uses the bank-reported transaction date when supplied, otherwise the earlier booking or value date as an inferred fallback. The response separates gross debit totals into `booked`, `pending`, and `held` in `totalsByStatus`. Undated debits and unknown statuses are excluded from totals. `incompleteReasons` explains scan limits, repeated cursors, inferred dates, and exclusions. The provider query uses seven-day padding to catch nearby postings; neither padding nor `complete: true` guarantees that a bank supplied every historical payment.

These totals are account activity, not classified household expenses: internal transfers, cash withdrawals, and card repayments may be included, and refunds are not netted. `finance_summarize_cash_flow` includes only booked records, enforcing the status filter locally as well as at the provider. Its credits are not necessarily income and its debits are not necessarily expenses. List and search tools use the provider's date-range semantics; those filters are not guaranteed to select purchase dates.

See [the API-to-MCP mapping](docs/api-to-mcp.md) for the preserved fields, derived values, and interpretation limits.

Date ranges include both endpoints and cover at most 366 calendar days. Search and summary scans stop on repeated provider continuation keys and mark the result incomplete instead of repeatedly fetching the same page.

For a complete balance refresh, call `finance_get_balances` once without an `accountId`. It discovers
all active sessions itself, so a preceding `finance_list_accounts` call is unnecessary. The response
keeps successful balances when another account fails and reports safe per-account errors separately.
Do not immediately retry accounts reporting `aspsp_rate_limited`.

## Installation

Installation establishes three separate trust relationships: the Worker proves its identity to Enable Banking, the bank grants the Worker a revocable consent, and Cloudflare Access limits who can call the MCP.

| Step | What it establishes | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Register the Enable Banking application | Worker → Enable Banking identity | The application UUID and RSA key sign provider requests |
| Link accounts in the Enable Banking dashboard | Production account whitelist | A restricted application may fetch data only from pre-approved personal accounts |
| Deploy the Worker | Private MCP runtime and session storage | Cloudflare runs the code and provisions KV for session IDs only |
| Enable Cloudflare Access and Managed OAuth | MCP client → Worker identity | The private Worker rejects callers who are not explicitly allowed |
| Connect each bank through `/setup` | Bank consent and active Enable Banking session | Whitelisting limits scope; bank authorization actually grants API access |

### 1. Prepare Cloudflare and Enable Banking

You need:

- a Cloudflare account with a `workers.dev` subdomain and Zero Trust;
- an Enable Banking restricted-production application;
- the application's UUID and RSA private key.

Choose the Worker name before registering the Enable Banking application. Register this callback URL, replacing both placeholders:

```text
https://<worker-name>.<account-subdomain>.workers.dev/callback
```

Register a production application, generate its RSA key outside the browser, and upload the matching public certificate in PEM format. Keep the private key: the deploy flow will store it as a Worker secret, and it must never be committed or shared.

In the Enable Banking Control Panel, link every account the restricted application may access. Dashboard linking is the production whitelist; it does not authorize a session for the application. The Worker completes that second authorization through `/setup` after deployment. See Enable Banking's [linked-account guide](https://enablebanking.com/docs/api/linked-accounts).

This repository is intended for personal, non-commercial use. Confirm that your deployment complies with Enable Banking's current terms.

### 2. Deploy to Cloudflare

Use the **Deploy to Cloudflare** button above. Cloudflare's deploy flow will:

1. copy the repository into the user's GitHub or GitLab account;
2. ask for `ENABLE_BANKING_APPLICATION_ID` and `ENABLE_BANKING_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`;
3. provision the `SESSION_STORE` KV namespace;
4. attach the Cloudflare Access policy required by this project;
5. build and deploy the Worker with Workers Builds.

The two secret fields initially contain masked placeholder values read from `.dev.vars.example`: an all-zero UUID and a `replace-me` private key. They are not existing credentials. Replace both fields with the production application UUID and private key before deploying.

Cloudflare presents Access as optional because Workers can be public, but it is required by this project. On the deployment page, enable **Protect with Cloudflare Access**, choose **All traffic**, and add an authentication policy. For a personal deployment, allow only your exact identity (or your Cloudflare account if only trusted members belong to it). **Previews only** does not protect the production Worker.

Cloudflare documents this behavior in [Deploy to Cloudflare buttons](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/deploy-buttons/).

### 3. Enable Managed OAuth

1. Open Zero Trust → Access controls → Applications → the Access application created during deployment.
2. Open **Advanced settings**, enable **Managed OAuth**, and save.

If **Protect with Cloudflare Access** was not enabled during deployment, attach Worker-level Access manually before continuing. Until Access is attached, the Worker fails closed with `403 access_required` because Cloudflare did not provide `ctx.access`. Worker-level Access protects `/`, `/setup`, `/callback`, and `/mcp` across the Worker's associated domains. See Cloudflare's [Worker-level Access guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cloudflare-access/).

Managed OAuth exposes the protected-resource and authorization-server discovery metadata used by MCP clients. Cloudflare validates the request before Worker invocation; this project does not duplicate Cloudflare's JWT verifier.

### 4. Authorize your banks

1. Open `https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/setup`.
2. Choose the country and whether the login is personal or business, then select the bank from Enable Banking's live supported-bank list.
3. Authorize access at the bank. The callback validates `state`, exchanges the one-time code, and stores only the resulting session ID in KV.
4. Repeat for each separate bank login. One authorization may expose multiple accounts.

If consent expires or is revoked, return to `/setup`, remove the inactive session, and connect the bank again. Removing a connection also asks Enable Banking to close its consent. Enable Banking creates new session and account IDs during reauthorization; the MCP discovers them automatically.

### 5. Connect an MCP client

Use this MCP URL:

```text
https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/mcp
```

## Verification

Before connecting a model, confirm:

- unauthenticated requests are rejected by Access;
- `/setup` lists only sessions created by this deployment;
- MCP `tools/list` exposes exactly the six tools above;
- `finance_list_accounts` returns opaque account IDs but no IBANs;
- a small balance and transaction request succeeds;
- one all-account balance request returns successful accounts even when another account fails;
- Cloudflare logs contain no financial payloads, secrets, authorization codes, or session IDs.

There is intentionally no `/health` endpoint. Cloudflare Workers do not require one, and `/mcp` plus the protected setup page are the meaningful application checks.

## Security properties

- Fixed upstream origin: requests can only go to `https://api.enablebanking.com`.
- Fixed provider operations: setup can start, complete, and close account authorization; MCP tools perform only documented read calls.
- User-triggered account reads forward bounded `Psu-Ip-Address` and `Psu-User-Agent` values derived
  from the incoming Cloudflare request; session discovery and authorization requests do not receive
  those headers.
- Account enforcement: every supplied account ID must belong to an active stored session.
- Setup and callback routes are behind Worker-level Access and validate origin/state.
- Authorization codes are exchanged immediately and never persisted.
- KV stores only session IDs and is encrypted at rest by Cloudflare.
- Bounded inputs, dates, pages, results, upstream responses, and timeouts.
- Provider failures log only a normalized operation, HTTP status, allowlisted provider error code,
  and bounded `Retry-After` value—never identifiers, request headers, provider bodies, or financial data.
- No payments, generic HTTP tools, financial-data persistence, response caching, CORS, or sensitive logging.

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for the threat model and disclosure policy.

## Development

```sh
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run check
```

Tests run in the Cloudflare Workers runtime and cover configuration, Access fail-closed behavior, setup authorization, session discovery, account enforcement, MCP tool schemas, Enable Banking JWT construction, normalization, and bounded responses.

## Provider scope

Enable Banking is the first provider module. Future providers should expose the same narrow normalized finance interface rather than leaking generic provider HTTP operations into MCP tools. Contributions must remain read-only from MCP and include tests for identifier validation and response normalization.
